## Wanted. The wish of have it is almost criminal 

A e-commerce that sell everything.

The idea is simulate a real e-commerce for the class of Internet Programing without the logistics and the payment process.
The e-commerce going to have a list of fake products of several categories, that can be filter per name and categories (maybe brand too). Our client will be able to create a account, login and handle with a shopping cart.

### Used theme of the site was reach in [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative)

We applied the its css and js for interact with our navigation bar and to set the deafult and padronized style for the HTML tags.
