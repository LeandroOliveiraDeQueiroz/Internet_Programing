## Wanted. The wish of have it is almost criminal 

A e-commerce that sell everything.

The idea is simulate a real e-commerce for the class of Internet Programing without the logistics and the payment process.
The e-commerce going to have a list of fake products of several categories, that can be filter per name and categories (maybe brand too). Our client will be able to create a account, login and handle with a shopping cart.

### Used theme

The utilized theme was withdrawn from the “Creative” template of the site [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative). This template consists in a single page application with a navigation bar that always is at the top of the screen. The rest of the page is divided in sections with the back-ground either orange, white or created by images. 

The CSS and JavaScript files were applied to be able to use the navigation bar style and the color palette in all the pages.
